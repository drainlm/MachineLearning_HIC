Predicting Future Requirements for Homeless Services Across US States using time series analysis and forecasting.

### Data:

The primary dataset is sourced from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Exchange [Housing Inventory Count (HIC) by State](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/), which includes data from 2022-2007, though we will only be looking at data from 2022-2014.

Additionally, [census data](https://www.census.gov/) for each state population was added for [2014-2019](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html) and [2020-2022](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html).
